#A Gentle Journey through Network Automation

###Backdrop

Network automation is a booming area in the field for IT.

###Philosophy of network automation

Setting up a network involves a lot of configurations such as assigning ips to PC's and network interfaces, implementing routing protocols, setting up banners, access control to routers and switches and the list goes on. Everytime when we need to takeup these tasks, we need to ssh or telnet to these devices from a PC and then take up the configurtions.This requires the PC to be in the same network as that of the target devices.
**Aim of network automation is to have a control over all of the devices(in any network) from a single devices.**
