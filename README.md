Network automation is a booming area in the field of IT.

# Philosophy of network automation

Setting up a network involves a lot of configurations such as assigning ips to PC's and network interfaces, implementing routing protocols, setting up banners, access control to routers and switches and the list goes on. Everytime when we need to takeup these tasks, we need to ssh or telnet to these devices from a PC and then  configure the properties. Aim of network automation is to have a control over all of the devices(in any network) from a single devices. 
In this project, simple router configurations are configured using a simple scripting language - YAML.
